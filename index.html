            <h4>Investment Philosophy</h4>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Embrace Uncertainty</strong> </span>– We think
                    about investing as making moves into the right side of the chart, because every
                    moment is unique and anything can happen on the right side of the chart, it’s
                    impossible to be right all of the time.  Thus, we do not need to be always right to
                    be successful in the market, we need to get through the worst days in the market. 
                    We don’t want to survive “on average 99.5%”.  When it comes to survival, we want to
                    survive through the absolute worst days when the most unexpected events developed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Manage Risk</strong> </span>– To deal with
                    down-side uncertainty effectively, it’s critical to understand the risk, recognize
                    it, and have a consistent approach to deal with it.  It does not mean we can
                    understand everything.  It means we understand the critical dimensions that
                    influence the game as well as acknowledge that there are many things beyond our
                    knowledge boundaries.  Thus, we always proceed with caution.  The best investors
                    make a kill by investing boldly into novel ideas, but with careful calculations and
                    caution.  To our investment system, risk management is key.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Invest Consistently </strong></span>– One of
                    the most tricky thing about investment is that the process can be done perfectly the
                    same between two trades, but the outcomes can be radically different.  That’s
                    explained by uncertainty.  As we cannot ensure the results in investment world, our
                    truest investment goal is not how many percent we make at the end of the year but
                    is to execute every trade idea consistently with the belief that the results will
                    come accordingly in the long-run.  At Altair Cliff, we believe investment is a
                    massive mechanism governs by expected value equation.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Go for the Home Run</strong></span> &#8211; In
                    rare times, and when they come, we will go for the Home Run.  There are times when
                    we earn the right to be aggressive, we will be aggressive and go after the kill.  To
                    have an extraordinary journey in investment, we have to survive the most severe
                    times, grind it out through normal times, and move in for the kill in certain
                    fortunate moments.  In order to locate those moments, we continuously seach and
                    study for every market and life dimension.  We don&#8217;t know to know but know to
                    act.  Still, in turbulence time, the market can behave erratically with substantial
                    volatility that we can end up losing capital even though we are right about the
                    event.  Thus, even on those specific moments, we mandate ourselves to be cautious
                    and be defensively aggressive.</li>
