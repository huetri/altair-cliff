After long holidays in the West, the first trading day (Jan 4th) happened to be particularly interesting.  After the event of executing Nimr, a Shitte leader in Arab Saudi, Iranian people were angry and attacked Arab Saudi’s Embassy in Tehran that invoked Arab Saudi, Bahrain, and Sudan to announce cutting diplomatic tie to Iran as a retaliation act within a currently very complex geo-political situation in Middle East.  Investors in China sold a massive amount of shares in the first trading session of the year (down 7% in Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and 3.9% in Shanghai Composite) after rumors that the government would lift the ban of stock sales that originally issued to administratively prevent the index to fall last year.  European markets fell between 3-4% across major stock indices follow China and had the worst first trading day of the year in history.  US market started trading in New York as the worst in 84 years with initial drop of 2%-2.5% of S&amp;amp;P and DJIA pre-market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Middle East alone, there are many developments that have the potential magnitude of a major global impact: (1) Syria’s civil war, (2) ISIS, (3) Terrorism in Europe, (4) extreme right wing’s shift of Europe political atmosphere, (5) Syria refugee crisis, (6) US-Russia conflict in casting soft power into Middle East after Crimea crisis, (7) Conflict between Arab countries and Iran (two largest oil OPEC exporters) as a symbol of conflict between the Shittes and the Sunni in the context of historic low oil price, and (8) Economic/diplomatic conflict between Russia and Turkey.  The list above did not account for traditional conflicts and risks such as Israel-Palestine, Chinese-Indian border conflict in the East.  Outside of the Middle East, China is both increasing geo-political influence to Asia (South China Sea, Hong-Kong, Taiwan) and Africa (Zimbawe adopts Reminbi as its official currency) and dealing to its own substantial economic risk that is more and more visible and can very well be the next tipping point for a crisis at global scale that might lead to shifts in geo-politics in Asia.  North Korea declared testing H-bomb successfully (Jan 6th) that pushes conflict between this country versus South Korea and other East Asia countries to the next level.  We can add conflicts between Russia and the West as well as Brazilian economic crisis to the list as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these current global developments, what is the key development theme of the markets for 2016?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is: I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a way of thinking in which 40% believe in consistently generating alpha by superior timing and selection/allocation and 60% believe in uncertainty and randomness that Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) tries to prove.  The I-Don’t-Know school of thought is influenced by EMH, still, there are several critical implications to investors that are more practical to apply comparing to completely following EMH (such as Index Funds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I-Don’t-Know school of thought following investors create a larger psychological room comparing to I-Know investors to accept all possibilities of the future as well as trying to not forcing their own subjective personal view into the objective developments of the market.  This creates a more relaxed and humble stand, that deals with unexpected risks better than the I-Know investors.  If I’m sure that Bank A’s cash depositing rate is 10% and Bank B’s cash depositing rate is 11%, no default as well as any other risks involved, then I will deposit 100% of my cash into Bank B.  This example represents I-Know school of thought.  Besides, there is no uncertainty in this example.  Now let’s say I have the opportunity to invest into stock of company A with expected return of 25% annually and make angel investment into a group of friends (old friends, all have PhDs) that are making space rocket to Mercury and buy the first foreign currency denominated Mongolian’s government bond, deciding how to make capital allocation depends substantially from my own subjective view about how the future would unfold.  Stock A may only achieve 5% return due to a conflict between Russia and Kazakhstan that affects company A’s business in exporting to Kazakhstan.  The group of friends who do rocket science may create a bigger rocket after 10 times of failures that now can shoot it to Jupiter instead of just Mercury.  Mongolian government may default on its obligation after the heir of Genghis Khan wins a historic election, decides to cut tie to global economy, and rebuilds their cavalry to invade North Korea.  Only with these three opportunities, I am already quite unsure on how the future will unfold needless to say about how the world will unfold next year given its complexity.  Thus, accepting to be “I-Don’t-Know” will generally make the investors wiser and avoid internal conflicts in decision making, being too hesitating or too aggressive, comparing to investors who follow I-Know school of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I-Don’t-Know school of thought will lead to a better risk managing practice by generally reducing sizes of each investing idea comparing to concentration as a key implication of I-Know school of thought.  By proactively accept the market as unfathomable in absolute sense, the I-Don’t-Know investors will actively develop a defensive investing mechanism to deal with extremely rare and significant risks that is inherently unavoidable from the financial markets.  Overall, these investors will neutralize betwen good years (with expected returns generally less than aggressive investors) and bad years (with expected returns generally better than aggressive investors).  However, because extremely rare and significant risks can threat to survivability, these I-Don’t-Know investors believe they will generate better long-term compounding returns based on consistency in their decision making and investing method regardless of how future unfolds.  Long-terms means 10 to 15 years and longer.  This perspective can compare Warren Buffett’s returns to Hedge Funds’ returns, it’s rare for Warren Buffett to be the best performer in the market in any given year, but within 20-30 years, it’s rare too for any Hedge Fund to generate higher compounded returns comparing to Warren’s returns in relations to their implied risks.  The reason is high achiever funds (such as funds with annual returns of 45% that result from aggressiveness would often be significantly exposed when the extremely rare and significant risks unfold, especially during crises as the case of LTCM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the question: What is the key development theme of the markets for 2016?  I think there is a great answer to that question and the answer will always be right even we change 2016 to 2026 or 2036, it is: Uncertainty.  Uncertainty is the key theme of market development that I truly feel over the years since I engaged in financial markets.  It is indeed higher every year, that strengthens my belief in investing defensively and risk managing actively will generate superior results comparing to investing aggressively.  One note, investing defensively is different to defensive investing, the former is about mindset and the later is about strategy.  Of course, there will be time the investors feel strongly about a market and there will be time the investors earn the right to be aggressive even though they follow I-Don’t-Know school of thought.  Still, the investors who follow I-Don’t-Know school of thought will always be proactive in defending against risks even though they changed from defensive mode to aggressive mode – or defensively aggressive.  That, I believe, in case the markets unfold really unexpectedly they can handle the risks that threaten their survival better and, more importantly, be more calm as they have always leave a large room in their perspective to deal with those kinds of risks.&lt;/p&gt;

It means it has the probability to happen as a range of outcomes.  Because among those outcomes only one will materialize, people often forget and/or underestimate what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We separate risk from uncertainty.  Uncertainty is measured by variance or standard deviation.  Take variance for example, variance measures the various degree of outcome (thus comes the term variance) comparing to the mean.  Outcomes involve around the mean can come in upside as well as downside.  Let’s say investors invest in the stock market with expectation to earn 7% a year is the mean, then a return of 9% of a particular year as well as a loss of -3% of another particular year are outcomes of variance.  Mean outcome does not mean that the outcome will come out as right at the mean.  Some years it will above the mean, some years it will come below the mean; but averagely all of the good and bad will average down to the mean as expected return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk does not mean variance or standard deviation, even though traditional finance metrics often use standard deviation to measure “risk”.  Increase variance increases volatility, and in term, increase both the expected downside and the expected upside.  When an investor invest with the expected return of 7%, a return of 9% will not be considered a risk-outcome has materialized.  The investor will enjoy this upside variance, thinking herself genius.  When an investor invest with the expected return of 7% and come a return of -3%, this downside variance will be seen as a risk-outcome has materialized.  As you see, upside variance is not the risk we worry about.  If volatility comes and gives me the chance to increase my expected return of 7% to 9% year in and year out, I will be happy to increase volatility of my portfolio to the max.  The issue is, when increase volatility, we do not know what will happen among a range of probable outcomes: +9% will come? +11% will come? -8% will come? Or -3% will come?  Volatility is both your friend and foe.  Risk, or the downside volatity, is your foe alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky part of dealing with risk is to understand that risk is not the single final outcome that comes out in the end.  Such as in the above scenario, in one particular year, the realized return is -3%, this is a loss but not a risk.  Risk is more than that.  Risk does not black and white dictate a particular negative return.  Risk is a range of outcomes that, depends on investors, return negatively of zero or below a certain benchmark such as risk free rate or index return.  To say that to invest into Vietnam Stock Market that has the expected return of +7% and averagely of the down years, the index returned a loss of averagely -5% is underestimate the risks involved.  That does not mean when investing into Vietnam Stock Market, the investor should expect a return of 7% on normal years and a -5% of a bad year.  We will never know in advance how bad it can be and history crises are not indicative of future disasters.  Future disasters can be worse.  One prominent example of this statement is the crisis of 1997 and 2007.  To Asian people, a crisis of the magnitude of 1997 had never been perceived to these young nations (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, Russia post Soviet era).  To the US, a crisis of 2007 is of magnitude of 1929 crash.  I don’t believe anyone who is active in the market in 2007 have experience live what happened during 1929-1936.  Even Warren Buffett and George Soros were both born after that (1930).  So what happened during 1997 and 2007 were so new, so strange, and so novel to everybody.  Thinking back on some of the major economic events, we will come to same conclusion: Black Monday 1987 market crash is the largest one day drop in percentage of DJIA – very novel, 2010 flash crash is another unusual risk-outcome that came alive – very novel and unprecedent in finance history, oil spikes during 1973 crisis resemble the oil price spike in 1861 in the United States – but again, noone experience both 1861 oil crisis and 1973 oil crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2015/12/Flash-Crash-Chart.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How frequently these rare events, much worse than expectation comes around?  Post World War II, we have Nixon Shock (1971) that led to US Dollar near crash (to date, it is the single event that led to nearly rejection of USD as the global currency, established after Bretton Woods in 1944), Oil Crisis of 1973, 1980 Latin debt crisis, 1987 market crash (world-wide, not only DJIA), 1990 Japan Stock/Estate Bubble burst (still on a prolonged loss-era after 20 years now in Japan), 1997 Asia Financial Crisis, 2001 Tech Bubble, 2008 Mortgage Crisis.  Except a peaceful period from 1945 to pre-1970, we have 8 major global financial crises during the last 40 years.  Now we should really start to question how frequently these rare events happen.  My most plain and unsophisticated conclusion is that these rare things do come around so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s return back to 2005 and think of what is the probability of an event with the magnitude of 2007-2008 crisis to happen?  The truth is on Wall Street there were a significant underestimate of risk in quant models among large banks and hedge funds.  A magnitude of 2007-2008 is unprecedent to anyone who were participating in the market at that time, thus, noone ran a model with worst case outcomes that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2015/12/Capture.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of new complex geo-political delopments in the most recent years, I remind myself as a practitioner in the financial market that not to count too high on anything and to keep my mind open to any possibility.  We don’t know what outcome will unfold among all possibilities and magnitude of bad case of scenarios are often underestimated: it can be worse than any bad experience ever perceived and worse than the worst case scenarios.  Extremely bad rare cases do come around even though the probability for such event is low.  Investors should be invest very cautiously all the time and try their best to understand what risks involved.  As the old saying goes, it’s fatal not to know what you are doing and as you don’t see the risk ahead, it does not mean there is no risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;
